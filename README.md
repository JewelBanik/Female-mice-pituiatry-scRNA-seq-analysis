# Female-mice-pituiatry-scRNA-seq-analysis
Single-cell RNA sequencing of pituitary cells from control female animals indicates that both Msi1 and Pou1f1 mRNAs are expressed in Gh-expressing somatotropes. Pituitaries from 8-week-old, control, diestrous FVB females bearing 2 alleles each of floxed MSI1 and MSI2 (n = 6) were collected and individually dispersed. Following mechanical dispersion, cells were pelleted and washed once with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM). Cells were pelleted again and fixed with methanol according to the 10x Genomics methanol fixation protocol. The morning of sample submission, cells were rehydrated and pooled into 2 pools of 3 pituitaries each. Each pool was then counted and submitted for processing to the Genomics Core at the Arkansas Children’s Hospital Center for Translational Pediatric Research. Single-cell 3′ library generation was performed using a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller and the v3 reagent kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cell suspensions were loaded onto the middle 4 channels of a chromium single-cell A chip according to the manufacturer’s instructions, aiming for 10 000 cells per channel. Following generation of single-cell gel bead-in-emulsions, reverse transcription, fragmentation, and complementary DNA (cDNA) amplification, library preparations and bar coding were performed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were validated with a fragment analyzer for fragment size and quantified by use of a Qubit fluorometer. A total of 200 pM of each library was pooled for sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform using a high output flow cell (100 cycles) to generate approximately 25 million 75 base reads per sample. 10x Genomics Cell Ranger 3.1.0 mkfastq wrapper and was used to perform sample demultiplexing and generate fastq files.
